# Approach Explained,  Well commented code, O(N) time, CPP C++ solution

### UPVOTE IF YOU FIND THIS HELPFUL

#### So, what i have done here is, we know that we can either make tops same or bottoms same. And, in that also, we have 2 choices . So the choices are listed below.
* 1. We can make all the tops value =  tops[0]
* 2. We can make all the tops value =  bottoms[0]
* 3. We can make all the bottoms value =  tops[0]
* 4. We can make all the bottoms value =  bottoms[0] 
Now, we can afford to run 4 loops of O(N), so we will run four loops. But we will not perform any swapping operations. We will only count if the swapping is possible...
So when we swap, we need to make sure of following condition. {Ex: i am going to perform everything on top for example.}
Ex: tops = [2,1,2,4,2,2], bottoms = [5,2,6,2,3,2]
* 1. check if the value at top is same as the value to be swapped. If its is true, then continue, we don't have to do swapping. 
* 2. check if the value that we are swapping is actually the value that is going to make all the tops same. Meaning, if we are making all the tops = 2, and we don't get the value 2 at any position in top or bottom then, we cannot make everything equal, then we will break from the loop.
These conditions are well understood when looked up in code. 

### Conditions to check
```
if(tops[i]==a){continue;}
	else{
		if(bottoms[i]==a){a_swap++;} 
		else{ a_swap = INT_MAX; break;}
	}
}
```


# Solution 


```
class Solution {
public:

        int a = tops[0];
        int b = bottoms[0];
        int a_swap = 0;
        int b_swap = 0;
        int c_swap = 0;
        int d_swap = 0;
        
        
        //TRYING TO MAKE TOPS SAME...
        
        //first make everything in top as top[0].
        for(int i=1;i<tops.size();i++){ 
            if(tops[i]==a){continue;}
            else{
                if(bottoms[i]==a){a_swap++;} 
                else{ a_swap = INT_MAX; break;}
            }
        }
        
        //second make everything in top as bottom[0].
        for(int i=0;i<bottoms.size();i++){
            if(tops[i]==b) {continue;}
            else{
                if(bottoms[i]==b){ b_swap++;} 
                else{ b_swap = INT_MAX; break;}
            }
        }
        
		// TRYING TO MAKE ALL THE BOTTOMS SAME
		
        // third make everything in bottom as tops[0].
        for(int i=0;i<tops.size();i++){ 
            if(bottoms[i]==a){continue;}
            else{
                if(tops[i]==a){ c_swap++;}
                else{ c_swap = INT_MAX; break;}
            }
        }
        
        //fourth make everything in bottom as bottom[0].
        for(int i=0;i<bottoms.size();i++){
            if(bottoms[i]==b) {continue;}
            else{
                if(tops[i]==b){ d_swap++;} 
                else{ d_swap = INT_MAX; break;}
            }
        }
        // at last we are checking for the minimum value, if we find that all the values are INT_MAX then return -1, otherwise return the min value.
        if(a_swap==INT_MAX && b_swap==INT_MAX && c_swap==INT_MAX && d_swap==INT_MAX) return -1;
        else return min(min(a_swap,b_swap),min(c_swap,d_swap));
    }
};
