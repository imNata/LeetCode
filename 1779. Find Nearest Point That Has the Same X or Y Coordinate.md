# âœ… Explained || Well Commented Code || C++ || Clean Solution
## Approach
* Everytime we will check if x is equal or not, if y is equal or not.
* If we find any one of these equal then, we will calculate the minimum distance between these points.
* And if the distance is minimum then we will return the index.

## Algorithm
* initialize `loc = -1` and `minDistance = INT_MAX`
* Run a loop from to n.
* For every iteration check if X cordinate is same `if(points[i][0] == x)` As well as if `if(points[i][1] == y)` Y cordinate is same.
* Now if we do not have any points that matches these 2 conditions we will return -1 at last which is stored in `loc` variable.
	* **Now coming onto IF statements.**
	* `If(points[i][0]==x)` then first check if the distance between point y is < minDistance or not?
		* If Yes, then store its index
	* Then, compute the minDistance between `abs(points[i][1]-y)` and store the minimum.
	* **Same is done for the ELSE IF Statement**
* return loc

class Solution {
public:
    int nearestValidPoint(int x, int y, vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        //first of all it should share either x or y cordinate. If it does not then return -1;
        int idx = -1;
        int minDistance = INT_MAX;
        for(int i=0;i<points.size();i++){
            if(points[i][0] == x){ //checking if the X cordinate is same or not.
                //if point x is same
                //then storing the index. Only if the Distance is minimum. If it is same then we have to return the val with minimum index.
				if(abs(points[i][1]-y)<minDistance){ 
                    idx = i;
                }
                minDistance = min(minDistance, abs(points[i][1]-y)); //calculating the minDistance so keep track of what is the minimum distance that we need in order to get same points.
            }
            else if(points[i][1] == y){
                //if point y is same
                if(abs(points[i][0]-x)<minDistance){
                    idx = i;
                }
                minDistance = min(minDistance, abs(points[i][0]-x));
            }
        }
		// now idx has the minimum index. If it did not found any index, then it have -1. Which is acc. to ques we have to return in case we did not found any solution.
        return idx;
    }
