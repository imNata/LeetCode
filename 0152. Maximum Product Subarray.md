# Approach
* Init currMin, currMax with 1 these will store the products.
* Now, init `ans` with first element and init z with 0. z increments when we have seen a zero.
* start loop 0->n
  *   if elem==0 then,
  *   reset currMax and min to 1 and increment z. Also continue;
  *   Init a temp variable with value = elem*currMax;
  *   Now, find currMax = max(elem, temp, currMin);
  *   Now, find currMin = min(elem, temp, currMin);
  *   Now update ans with maximum i.e max(ans,currMax)
* When out of loop, check if we have z>=1 if yes this means we have seen a zero, so we will return max(0,ans). //This is because it may be possible that actual ans = 0. But our ans = -1. because we did not compared it with 0. So that is why we are comparing with 0.
* Otherwise if z==0 then no need to comapre with 0. Directly return the answer.
