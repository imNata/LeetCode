# Bruteforce approach.. Tried to explain in the approach and in comments also
**NOTE: This is bruteforce approach. Please Upvote, if this helps you in any way...**
# What we have to do
* We needed to check for every transaction. That is 
```
for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
	for(int j=i+1;j<n+1;j++){
	//Something here
	}
}
```


# Approach Used
```
So basically what i did is:
	1. Used 3 data structures (set, map and vector)
	2. Then i sorted the given transactions vector. (Sorted so that same name transactions can be together to reduce the chances of running into TLE)
	3. Stored the freq of trxn in the map (for later use).
	4. Then, i traversed the given trxn array from start to n-1.
		 * Inside here, Again run a loop form i+1 -> n.
			 * Now used stringstream to get the name, city, amount and time. (Explained in comments)
			 * According to ques condition checked for invalid trxn. And inserted it in the set. (Using set here so that duplicate transactions can be automatically removed.)
			 * And checking if b>0? if yes then we break from the inner loop as the names have changed...Change of names means that now we are comparing BOB and ALICE which is useless so we break..
	 5. Now we have got the invalid transactions. So, now we will add them in the vector.
		 * For this first we check for the freq of ith element in the map. If it is greater than 0. Then we insert it as many times as it occured in the given trxn array.
	 6. Atlast return the ans.
