# âœ… Approach Explained || Algorithm || C++ || Well Commented Code

### Approach:
* Apporach is simple, we will check if we have any element that is 2* current element. 
* Also, we have to make sure that every element in the array must have doubled element or the element should be a doubled.
```
example:  [1,2,3,4,6,8]
In this, we have 1 => 2, 3=>6, 4=>8
Means either the element is a doubled element like 2,6,8 OR it has any doubled element 
like 1,2,3
```
* Also, we can now notice that, there should be even number of elements in the array if the array is doubled.  So, if we have odd, then simply return empty array.
* Another thing to note is, the number `0`. This will create problem in the code, so we will have to tackle this seperately. 



### Algorithm:
* if `changed.size()== odd` then `return {}`. `{}` means `empty vector`.
* Now, store every element in the `ordered map` with freq.
* Traverse through the map one by one.
	* **Seperate condition for 0.**
	* if freq of `0` is `odd` then `return {}`.
	* Othersie, we have to push it in the `ans` vector.
	```
		int f = i.second;
		for(int k=0;k<f/2;k++){
			ans.push_back(i.first);
		}
	```
	* **Condition for other than 0**
	* if `current element's freq is greater than 0 && i.first*2 freq>0 `
		* then, run a loop till any one of these two's freq is does not becomes 0.
			* `while(min(i.second,m[i.first*2]))`
				* and reduce both the elements freq by 1.
			```
			while(min(i.second, m[i.first*2])){
				ans.push_back(i.first);
                //now here reducing both the frequenices by 1;
				i.second--;
				m[i.first*2] --;
			}
			```
* Now, check if the new vectors size == n/2? If yes, then return the new vector, otherwise, return {}.

### Code:

```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findOriginalArray(vector<int>& changed) {
        // if size is odd then 1 element is missing means cannot be a doubled array.
        int n = changed.size();
        if(n&1) return {};
        
        map<int,int>m;
        
        //stored in map
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            m[changed[i]]++;
        }
        
        
        vector<int>ans;
        
        //traversing the map one by one.
        for(auto i:m){
            //this is special condition if we have 0 as an element.
            if(i.first==0){
                //then i have to do this seperately. If freq of 0 is odd then return empty vector.
                if(i.second&1) return {};
                // otherwise push the 0 into vector.
                int f = i.second;
                for(int k=0;k<f/2;k++){
                    ans.push_back(i.first);
                }
                //after successfully pushing into vector, continue as this may cause program to behave abnnormally.
                continue;
            }
            
            //for other than 0.
            //i am checking if current elements freq>0 or not as well as if the freq of 2*i.first>0 then only go inside the loop.
            
            if(i.second>0 && m[i.first*2]>0){
                //now here taking min freq of both. This is because i may have the first elements fre =1 and seconds = 3 so we can only make a pair so that is why i am taking the min.
                
                while(min(i.second, m[i.first*2])){
                    ans.push_back(i.first);
                    //now here reducing both the frequenices by 1;
                    i.second--;
                    m[i.first*2] --;
                }
            }
        }
        
        //checking if new vector's size< originalVectorSize()/2? if yes then it is not doubled
        // as the new vector size should be == orginal Vector size/2
        if(ans.size()<n/2) return {};
        return ans;
        
    }
};
