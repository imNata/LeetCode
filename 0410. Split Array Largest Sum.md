## Approach

* First we divide the problem into 2 subproblem. 
* Now, first we check if we can make a subarray with given splits and sum. Although we dont have suum, but we are asumming it for now.
	* So, if we can then we return true. Otherwise we return false.
* Now, we have 2nd part of the problem. We have solved almost 80% of problem in step 2. But now how to find the sum?
	* For that first we need to see. What if we have unlimited number of cuts? What would have been the sum we have got minimum?
		* EX: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and we have unlimited number of splits.
    then=> [1],[2],[3],[4],[5] we could have only splitted it in this way.
    So here we have sum = 5.
		* And in same way if we have 0 cuts or can create only 1 subarray, 
    then=> [1,2,3,4,5]
    So, here we have sum = 15
		* Now, we come to a conclusion that we can have the sum in between 5->15
    So now we got a range to find the sum.
* And we use binary search to find the required answer.

        int current_sum = 0;
        int splits = 0;
        for(auto i:nums){
            current_sum+=i;
            //if current sum exceeds the given sum then we need to make a cut
            if(current_sum>s){
                current_sum = i;
                splits++;
                //checking if our splits gets greater than given
                if(splits>m-1){
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;        
    }
    
    int bs(vector<int>&nums, int s, int e, int m){
        while(s<e){
            int mid = s+(e-s)/2;
            if(canSplit(nums, m, mid)){
                //we will not do mid-1 because our answer can also be the extreme point.
                e = mid;
            }
            else{
                s = mid+1;
            }
        }
        //at last when we come out of loop, we can say that our start pointer is pointing to the smallest sum.
        return s;
    }
    
    int splitArray(vector<int>& nums, int m) {
        //finding the range of sum...
        //start contains if we have unlimited number of cuts
        int start = *max_element(nums.begin(),nums.end());
        int sum = 0;
        //sum contains if we had only 1 subarray
        sum = accumulate(nums.begin(),nums.end(),sum);
        int end = sum;
        //applying binary search
        return bs(nums, start, end, m);
        
    }
};
