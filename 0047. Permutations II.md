# Approach

Using next_permutation a cpp stl function which returns all the possible permutation of a given vector or string.

SO NOW TO FOLLOW ALING WITH THIS QUESTION, I HAVE TO FIRST SORT THE VECTOR. 

This is because we can have a vectot like this [1,2,3,1,2] wherein all the possible answers would not be returned so we sort it. So that we can find all the possible permutations.

# Main To Note
* A thing here to note is that we sort the given vector first and then use next_permutation() on the vector.
* So, we are using do-while loop as the 1st sorted vector is also a possible permutation so we insert that into the vector.

# Code

```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> permuteUnique(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<vector<int>>ans;
        sort(nums.begin(),nums.end());
        do{
                ans.push_back(nums);
        }while(next_permutation(nums.begin(),nums.end()));
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```
