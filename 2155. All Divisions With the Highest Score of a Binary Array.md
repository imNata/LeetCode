# Approach
* Question says that we have to find the divisions where the sum of left and right subarray will be maximum.
* So, We are clear with one thing that array will contain only {0,1} so this becomes easy for us to count. As Question also says that the `sum of left subarray = number of 0's in it`. And `the sum of right subarray =  number of 1's in it`.
* So we will check for every point in the array and store the sum (left+right) along with index.
* Along side we will also store the maximum sum in a variable.
**NOTE: We can also sort the vector but that will give O(Nlogn) T.C so that is why we are storing maximum sum.
**

# Algorithm
* Count the number of ones in the given vector.
* Create a vector of pair of int to store score and index.
```
vector<pair<int,int>>v; //score,idx
```
* Next we loop in the given vector from 0->n
	* if we find a 0 then we increment the left otherwise we decrement the right
	* push the sum of left and right along with index.
	* store maximum result in vairbale
* Again loop in newly created vector and store the maximum's score in the new vector and return it.

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> maxScoreIndices(vector<int>& nums) {
        int one = 0;
        one = accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(),one); //this will give the number of 1's.
        int zero = nums.size()-one; //this will give us the number of 0's.
        
        vector<pair<int,int>>v; //score,idx
        v.push_back({one,0}); //for the empty left subarray index...
        
        int ma = one;
        int right = one, left = 0;
        
        //we are traversing from left 
        //that means we are diving the array from left
        //So, now we initilized left with 0 and right with  = Ones.
        //As left will be empty first, and right will have the score of number of ones.
        
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++){
            //if we find 0 that means it will be included in the left subarray 
            if(nums[i]==0){
                //So, we increase the left...
                left++;
            }
            //But if we find 1 in left subarray that means we have to reduce it from the right subarray
            else {
                //Reducing 1 from right subarray only if we are encountered with 1.
                right--;
            }
            //At last score = left+right and index is i+1 as given in ques it is 0 based and we started from -1. 
            //Why -1? becasue left subarray can be empty.
            v.push_back({left+right,i+1});
            //storing the maximum sum found till now.
            ma = max(ma,left+right);
        }
        
        //Stores the indexes where the maximum score is found.
        vector<int>ans;
        
        for(int i=0;i<v.size();i++){
            //if score == maximum score, then store the index in ans.
            if(v[i].first==ma)
                ans.push_back(v[i].second);
        }
        
        return ans;
        
    }
};
