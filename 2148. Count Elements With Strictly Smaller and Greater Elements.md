# Explained âœ… Simple C++ Sol using MAP

#### Upvote if you find this helpful.

#### Approach:

* Step1: First we store all the elements in the map and their frequencies i.e how many times they have occured.
* Step2: Then we check if the size of the map is less than or equal to 2, we return 0. This is because we know if we have to find the strict max and min, we would need atleast 3 elements.
* Step3: Now, we initialise x and count with 0. X is a counter variable while count is counting the number of elements with strict minimum and maximum.
	* Number 1: if x==0 or if x==m.size()-1 then we do nothing. This is becase for 1st element in map, we will not have its strict minimum. And for last element in map, we will not have its strict maximum. This is why we are leaving them.
	* Number 2: count+=i.second . So if we are not at first or last of map. then we are saying that the element in the map has strict min and max. So as many times as this element occur in this, it will definitely have min and max. So we are adding its frequency to the count.
* Step4: Finally, we are returning the count.

class Solution {
public:
    int countElements(vector<int>& nums) {
        map<int,int>m;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++) {m[nums[i]]++;}
        if(m.size()<=2) return 0;
        
        int x = 0, count = 0;
        for(auto i:m){
            if(x==0 || x==m.size()-1){}
            else count+=i.second;
            x++;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```
