# Approach

* We will find 2 points, start and end.
* Init start = 0, AND end = -1; So that if our arr is already sorted, we can get (e-s+1) = (-1-0+1)=0
* How to find the points start and end? 
* We will check from start if any point is > next point. ```if nums[i]>nums[i+1]```
  * So if this is true, then we will store the point and this will keep running till last. From left to right. So this point will find the end point after which the array is sorted and we dont have to do anything.

* Now, we have to find the start point. To find that we will start from the last. Reverse traverse. And, if we find that ```nums[i]<nums[i-1]``` then we store it, and keep doing this till we are at the end.
* After that, we will return ```end-start+1```

        int end = -1;
        
        int max = nums[0];
        for(int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++){
            if(max > nums[i]){ // the left value is greater then current value
                end = i; // mark that index with end
            }
            else{
                max = nums[i];
            }
        }
        
        int start = 0;
        int min = nums[nums.size()- 1];
        for(int i = nums.size() - 2; i >= 0; i--){
            if(min < nums[i]){ // the right value is smaller then current value
                start = i; // mark that index with start
            }
            else{
                min = nums[i];
            }
        }
        return end - start + 1;
    }
};
