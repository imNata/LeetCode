# Approach
We are going to follow a approach that we follow when we traverse a binary tree in depth first search traversal. That is storing the child node if there exists a one. Here we are going to store the ```head->next``` if we encounter a child node.

# Algorithm

**Step1:** First, create a newHeadNode. And, create a vector of Node that will store child nodes, whenever we encounter a child node.

**Step2:** Start traversing the linked list ```while(head!=NULL)```
* First insert (insert here means that we are pointing to this node from newHead Node) the node in the newHeadNode.
* Now, move the newHeadNode ahead i.e ```newHeadNode = newHeadNode->next```
* Now, check if current head node has a child.
  * If this exists, then, store the address of the ``head->next``` node in the vector that we initialised earlier.
  * And, we will change the head pointer to child. That is now we want the head node to point to the child node. ```head = head->child```.
  * And, then continue. **Why continue?** Continuing so that we can traverse from the start of the child node. And, we will start from child node, that means we are going to push the child node. And start the same process again.

**Step3:** Now, when have completely traversed all the child nodes, then, we will start traversing the vector in reverse order and will traverse all the rest of the nodes. 

**Step4:** Atlast, we make doubly linked list and endings/childs as NULL.

**Step5:** Now, return the newHeadNode.
