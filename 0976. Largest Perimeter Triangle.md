# âœ… Approach || C++ || Easy || Clean Code
### Approach
* We follow a simple apporach of sum of heights.
* That is: if sum of two heights is greater than 3rd, then it is the largest perimeter of triangle that can be formed.
* i.e (a+b)>c then this will be the largest area.


### Algorithm
 * We will first sort the given array of heights, so that we do not have to traverse here and there in process.
 * Now while i is greater than 2. We will find the values of a, b, c and check for condition: (a+b)>c.
 * If the condition becomes true then, return it.
 * Otherwise, keep running the loop. And, at last you return 0.
 
 ## Code
 
	  

```
class Solution {
public:
    int largestPerimeter(vector<int>& nums) {
        sort(nums.begin(),nums.end());
        
        for(int i=nums.size()-1;i>=2;i--){
            int a=nums[i-2];
            int b=nums[i-1];
            int c=nums[i];
            if(a+b>c) return a+b+c;
        }
        return 0;
    }
};
```
