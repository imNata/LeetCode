## Explanation Of Question:
Question says we have atmost 8 neighbours and so, we will have to understand this first. 
This is the pictorial representation of the neighbours of a element.

* So, now we have clear understanding of what are 8 neighbours.


## Approach
* First we will find the neighbours of a element. 
* Then, we will check for the given 4 conditions. and update our answer according to it.

**HOW TO FIND NEIGHBOURS?**
* We will have neighbours in row-1, row+1 and current row. As well as on col+1 and col-1. This will give us all 8 neighbours. And, now main problem comes, How to calculate them?
* First make sure of base condition. That is, `rows` should not go `less than 0`.  And rows should not go beyond given size. And same follows for columns.

```
if(row-1<0) //means we have come before 0 i.e out of bound and this is not possible.
if(row+1>rowSize) //means we have gone a size beyond the given size. Which will give out of bound error.
if(col-1<0) //means we have come before 0 i.e  out of bound and this is not possible.
if(col+1>colSize) //means we have goen a size beyond the given size. Which will give out of bound error.
```
So for all these conditions our neighbours will fail to count. Hence we have to skip these.

## Code

```
class Solution {
public:
    
    //so i know that its like n queen problm. I.e i have to check its upper, lower, left right. this gives 8 nbrs.   
    // same row left = 1
    // same row right =2
    // upperrow left = 3, center = 4, right = 5,
    // downrow left = 6, center = 7, right = 8.

                vector<int>nbr(8,0);  //will store the nbrs in this array.
                
				//same row nbrs..
                if(j-1>=0){ //same left 1.
