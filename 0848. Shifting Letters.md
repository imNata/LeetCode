## Approach
Explained in image at end!!

**Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(1)**

## Algorithm
* Step1: Initialize a `count` variable with `0` that will store the number of times a character needs to be shifted.
* Step2: For loop from n->0 (end->start)
	* modify the count variable with the number of shifts. 
		`count = (count%26+shifts[i]%26)%26;`
	* Now, shift the character `count` times.
		`int a = (s[i]-'a' + count)%26;`
	* Store the shifter character.
	`s[i] = a+'a';`
* LOOP END
* Return the string `s`.

    // Approach is we will start from last.
    // We know that last character is shifted shifts[n] times only while other are shifted shifts[n]+shifts[n-1] times. and so on...
    // Now, as the value of shifts[i] can be <=10^9 this would give TLE. And to solve that we will mod it with 26. With 26 becasue we have a-z characters which counts to be 26.
    // and at last after shifting we will store them in the string s.
    string shiftingLetters(string s, vector<int>& shifts) {
        
        
        // this will store how many times will i have to shift the character.
        int count = 0;
        
        // starting from last, till the first character in both string and shifts vector.
        for(int i=s.size()-1;i>=0;i--){
            // we will store the value of shifts in count.
            // it is possible that after certain iterations, count can be > 26. so we mod it by 26.
            // it is also possible for shifts so we mod that also.
            // at last the sum of count+ shifts[i] can also reuslt in >26. So we mod that also.
            // and now COUNT contains the number of times we have to actually shift that character.
            count = (count%26+shifts[i]%26)%26;
            
            // (s[i]-'a') this will give relative indexing acc. to english alphabets.
            // here we have first checked the character and its relative index according to english character i.e 0->a , 1->b, 2->c ..... 25->z;
            // This is done so that we can add the shifts to the character.
            // After this we add the number of times the character needs to be shifted. Which is stored in count.
            // As we know that a character can only lie between (0-25) [a-z] that means we will mod it by 26. This is bacuse if we have to shift z by 3 times, it will give => 25+3 = 28. And we know that there are only 26 characters so we will mod it by 26. Which will give result as 2. And at 2 we have character `c`.
            int a = (s[i]-'a' + count)%26;
            // Now, that we have got the integer value corresponding to the character, we will convert it into character. And, store it in the string.
            s[i] = a+'a';
        }
        return s;
    }
};
