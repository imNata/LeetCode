# âœ…Approach Explained || Algorithm || Clean Code || C++ Solution
### Approach

* Appraoch is simple, we will check both the strings, for discontinuity and if we find any discontinuity, then we store that point. 
* If we do not find discontinuity [meaning when two string are different at certain point] means that strings are already equal.

### Algorithm

* Run a loop from `0`->`s1.size()`
* Check if `s1[i]!=s2[i]`
	* If true, then store the index of this position in idx array.
* Inside same loop, we check if the size of `idx` array `>=2` . This is because we have been asked if the strings are equal after 1 swap. So, 1 swap is possible with only 2 indexes.
	* If true, then `break` from the loop.
* Now here we check. If the `size` of `idx` array is `1` then we `return false`. This is because we have to swap. And for swapping anything we need 2 indices.
* Now, if we have `size` of `idx` array `==0 ` then, `return true`. This is because, both the strings are already same.
* And, last case, We swap the characters at index.
	* `swap(s2[idx[0]],s2[idx[1]])` this means that we are swapping the characters at position `idx[0]`, `idx[1]` in `s2`.
	* And, after swap if `return s1==s2`.

### Code



```
class Solution {
public:
    bool areAlmostEqual(string s1, string s2) {
        vector<int>idx; //storing the index
        for(int i=0;i<s1.size();i++){
                //if the values are not equal then store its index.
            if(s1[i]!=s2[i]){ 
                idx.push_back(i);
            }
            // if we have found more than 2 index where value does not match, 
            // then break.
            if (idx.size()>=2) break; 
        }
        // if size==1, then we cannot swap, as swapping needs 2 values.
        if(idx.size()==1)return false;
        // if size of idx is zero then strings are already equal
        else if(idx.size()==0) return true; 
        else {
            swap(s2[idx[0]],s2[idx[1]]); //swaping the indexes that we have found.
            return s1==s2; //if after swap both the string are same.
        }
    }
};
```
