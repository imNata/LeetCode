##### **NOTE**
I am using `static int` and not `long int` because the given constraints fit in the range.


```
class Solution {
public:
    //this map is our database which stores key->val in this order
    // tinyURL -> longURL
    
    map<string,string>database;
    
    string encode(string longUrl) {
        
         //base string which is common for all tinyURL
        string urlBase = "https://tinyurl.com/";
        
        //declaring as static so that it does not conflicts with any other URL.
        static int num = 0;
        
        string store = ""; //this will contain the new tinyURL
        
        store = urlBase+to_string(num);
        
        database[store] = longUrl; //storing the tinyURL in the database
        
        num++; //incrementing the num so that when a new URL is given, it will have a new URL.
        
        return store; //returning the new tinyURL
    }
    
    
    string decode(string shortUrl) {
        //if the given short URL is valid returning the value of the shortURL.
        return database[shortUrl];
    }
};

```
##### **HINT**
You can also try to use ASCII method. Its just a hint if you want to try-
As, we can design the algorithm of our choice, So rather than simply creating a URL which will show like this:
```
https://tinyurl.com/0
https://tinyurl.com/1
https://tinyurl.com/2
```
You can switch the parth where we are trying to use static INT and use ASCII value there.
