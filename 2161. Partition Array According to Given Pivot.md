// Approach
// We will first run loop for all the elements and store all the elements which are less than pivot
// In the same loop, we are also checking how many elements are there which are equal to pivot.
// Note, we are counting the equal elements, not creating or storing it in vector for now.
// This helps in reducing space complexity.
// Now Second step, we run loop till the number of times we have equal_count and store the pivot in the vector.
// Now, lastly, we will puch all the elements which are greater than pivot
// Return the vector.
```

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> pivotArray(vector<int>& nums, int pivot) {
        vector<int>small;
        
        //counter that counts how many numbers are there which are equal to pivot
        int equal_count = 0; 
        
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++){
            //first we put all the less than pivot element in array.
            if(nums[i]<pivot){
                small.push_back(nums[i]);
            }
            //and if we find element==pivot then we are incrementing the equal_count
            else if(nums[i]==pivot){
                equal_count++;
            }
        }
        
        //Now, in small vector, it is sure we have got <pivot elements in it and relative order is maintained.
        
        //Loop runs for equal_count times.
        for(int i=0;i<equal_count;i++){
            //now we are pushing the pivot element in the vector.
            small.push_back(pivot);
        }
        
        //Latly, we are checking for >pivot elements.
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++){
            //now we are pushing >elements into vector
            if(nums[i]>pivot){ small.push_back(nums[i]);}
        }
        
        // return the vector
        return small;
