# Approach Explained, Well Commented Code and O(N) C++ Solution


### Approach Used:

   * Step 1. Created a string of size n all filled with 'a'; 
    Resulting in:  aaa
	
    * Step 2. Now cerate a curr_sum variable that stores the size of our string.
    Resulting in: 3 (as a+a+a = 1+1+1 = 3)
	
        * (ii) Also reduce the K by N
        Resulting in K = K-N = 27-3 = 24
    * Step 3. Now, we have to create smallest string, So it will be good to start from last of string.
    That is form idx: 2
    * Step 4. Now, when in loop we have to make sure of following conditions.
        * (i) As we are working on the loop, and changing the last index, so we will have to reduce curr_sum and increment k back. This is because we are assuming that we have removed it from our string. 
        Meaning we have string: aa
		
        * (ii) At the same time, we are also incrementing the k with the value we have removed because previously in STEP 2(ii) we have decreased it.
        * (iii) Now we have to check for conditions We will check for 3 conditions which are dexcribed in STEP5.
    * Step 5. 
		* (i) Fristly, we will check if the K is greater than, 26. If we have greater than 26, then we will add 'z' and continue to the loop, At the same time, we will reduce the k and increment curr_sum.
        * (ii) Secondly, if we have k<=26 then, we will add 'k'th alphabet in the string. And increment the curr_sum by K.
        * (iii) If our curr_sum == total then we have successfully created the string and we don't have to do any more traversing And break.
    * Step 6. Return the string ans;

## Code Solution


```
class Solution {
public:
        string getSmallestString(int n, int k) {
        string ans(n,'a'); //fill the string with all a at first
        int total = k;
        int curr_sum = n; //this will store the sum of characters in ans string
        k = k-n;
        for(int i=n-1;i>=0;i--){
            curr_sum-=ans[i]-'a'+1;
            k+=ans[i]-'a'+1;
            // if the k val is greater than 26
			if(k>26){ 
                ans[i] = 'a'+25; //add 'z' in the string.
                k-=26; curr_sum+=26; //and change k as well as curr_sum
            }
			//otherwise, if k is less than 26
            else if(k<=26){
                ans[i] = 'a'+k-1; //then add the kth character in the ans.
                curr_sum+=k;
            }
            if(curr_sum==total) break; //check if curr_sum and total is equal then break;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
