### Algorithm
* Simple intution is rather than multiplying we check for negatives and zeroes, becasuse this is what will make an effect on the answer.
* So, we will check if anytime we encounter a `0` in the array, the we return 0. As any number multiplied by 0 gives 0.
* Secondly, if nums[i]<0 means if it is negative then increment the count of n i.e `n++`.
* After coming out of loop, check if n is odd or even? This is because we know if 2 negative numbers are multiplied, they will always give a +ve number. So if n is even, then return +1 . And if it is odd, then return -1.

### Code

```
class Solution {
public:
    int arraySign(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = 0; //counts number of negatives
        
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++){
            if(nums[i]==0) return 0;
            else if(nums[i]<0) n++;
        }
		//checking if n is odd
        if(n&1==1) return -1; 
        else return 1;
    }
};
```
