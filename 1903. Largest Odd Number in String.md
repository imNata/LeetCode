#### We know that a number is odd if its unit digit is odd.
So, we are going to follow this approach.

Initialize idx = -1 

##### idx initialized by -1 so that if we have no odd element in the string we should return empty string.

Step1: We will check from the last index, if the number at last index is odd then we will store its index.
* Otherwise, We will continue checking until we have found a odd number.
* If somehow, we get to a situation where we have traversed our string but, didn't find any odd number then we will return empty string.

Step2: Now, we would have got an index by now.
Step3: Create a for loop again, and traverse till the index we have got.
* keep adding the elements to the `ans`.
* Return `ans`.

## Code:

```
class Solution {
public:
    string largestOddNumber(string nums) {
        string ans = "";
        int idx= -1;
        for(int i=nums.size()-1;i>=0;i--){
            if((nums[i]-'0')%2!=0){
                idx = i;
                break;
            }
        }
        for(int i=0;i<=idx;i++){
            ans+=nums[i];
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
