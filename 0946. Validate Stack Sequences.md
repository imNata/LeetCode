public:
    bool validateStackSequences(vector<int>& pushed, vector<int>& popped) {
        stack<int>s;
        int x=0; //index counter for popped array
        
        for(int i=0;i<pushed.size();i++){
            
            //if at any point the element inserted in the stack is equal to the element at index x in popped array, then we need to pop it recursively...
            if(!s.empty() && popped[x]==s.top()){     
                while(!s.empty() && popped[x]==s.top()) {s.pop(); x++;}
            }
            
            //otherwise keep pushing in the stack.
            s.push(pushed[i]);
        }
        
        //now there may be a possiblity that the last element inserted in the stack could have resulted in the invalid sequence or valid sequence. So, we are again checking if the condition holds true or not.
        while(!s.empty() && popped[x]==s.top()) {s.pop(); x++;}
        
        //if the counter variable x becomes equal to the size of popped elements size, then we have traversed the whole popped array and it is a sequence. This is because we are incrementing x only if this condition is true: popped[x]==s.top()
        if(x==popped.size())return true;
        
        //otherwise the sequence is invalid return false
        return false;
        
    }
