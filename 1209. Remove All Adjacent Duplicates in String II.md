# Approach
Intution we are going to follow is create a stack and store the frequency of the element (same adjacent element).
After which we will remove the element if the fre1. reaches to k.

# Example & Explanation

**Create a stack:** ```stack<pair<char,int>>s```
**Example String:** ```aabdaa```

<table>
<th>Character</th>
<th>Occurence</th>
<tr>
<td>a</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>b</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>d</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>a</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
</table>


This stack holds the character, and its adjacent occurences.

Example:
   
   a=2

   b=1
   
   d=1
   
   a=2

So if we had k==2, then both a's will be removed and resulting answer will be: "bda"


# Algorithm:

**Step1:** We will create a stack of pairs i.e ```stack<pair<char,int>>```

**Step2:** Now, initially push the 1st element of the string in the stack and its freq=1

**Step3:** Now, traverse the string and check for 3 conditions.
    * if stack is not empty and the current character is same as the character in stack top, then inc its freq.
    * else, push the element in the stack and freq=1
    * Now again check if the fre of the element in the stack = k then pop it.
    
**Step4:** Create a string ```res=""```. And traverse the stack.
    * if teh top element of the stack has freq==k, then pop it and continue,
    * otherwise store it in the string.

**Step5:** Reverse the ```res``` and return.

class Solution {
public:
    string removeDuplicates(string s, int k) {
        if(k==1) return "";
        
        //this stack holds the character, and its adjacent occurences.
        //String: aabdaa
        //Ex: a=2
        //    b=1
        //    d=1
        //    a=2
        //So if we had k==2, then both a's will be removed and resulting answer will be: "bda"
        stack<pair<char,int>>st;
        st.push(make_pair(s[0],1));
        
        int count = 1;
        
        //use pair to keep track of previous element occurences.
        //i can create a stack of the strings and then can choose from those if the adjacent are getting 
        //to k then remove otherwise keep pushing.
        
        for(int i=1;i<s.size();i++){
            //if the element in the stack is same as s[i], then increment its count.
            if(!st.empty() && st.top().first==s[i]){
                st.top().second++;
            }
            //otherwise, pussh this element in the stack with count = 1
            else {
                st.push(make_pair(s[i],count));
            }
            //now again checking when we incremented the count as well as inserted it in the satack
            //If somehow, our stack's top value have become equal to the given k, then pop.
            if(st.top().second==k){
                    st.pop();
            }
        }
        
        string res = ""; //stores new string.
        while(!st.empty()){ //continue until the stack is empty.
            if(st.top().second==k){ //now again checking if stack's top elements freq == k , then pop
                st.pop();
                continue;
            }
            //if the elements frequency is not equal to the top, then, stored it in the res string.
            //NOTE: we can have multiple occurence of a character which is stored in the freq, that is how many times, this element appeared.
            while(st.top().second--) 
                res += st.top().first;
            st.pop();
        }
        //Atlast, reversing the string. As stack has given us the string in this order
        // dcba while the answer should be : abcd
        reverse(res.begin(),res.end());
        return res;
