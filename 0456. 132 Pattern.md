# Approach
Intution is to first find the **minimum till current index** and store it in new array.

So this minimum will be used as left element of 132 pattern.

While, the vector ```nums``` elements will be used as middle element.

Now for the **right element**, we will be **using stack**.

Stack, is going to contain the right element but before we get into stack. We need to observe the Ques again. If i consider the pattern 132 as left middle right then, In order to be a pattern this should be followed
* middle>left and middle>right
* left<middle and left<right
* right<middle and right>left

**NOTE:** We will be traversing from last to follow greedy approach.
* So, when we are finding right element we need to check for 3 conditions.
  * if we find that the element at the top<=left element, then we need to pop elements until the stack becomes empty or the element at stack top>left. ```while(!s.empty() && s.top()<=l) s.pop();```
  * else if the stack is empty then we need to push the nums[i] element in the stack. ```s.push(nums[i]);```
  * if the stack is not empty and the element at the stack > left also, it is < middle then return true. ```if(!s.empty() && s.top()<mid && s.top()>l) return true;```
                
**Time Complexity: O(N) 
Space Complexity:O(N)**

# Code
```
class Solution {
public:
    bool find132pattern(vector<int>& nums) {
        //first create a minimum vector.
        //creating of same size as nums and inititally it will have maximum elem in it.
        vector<int>m(nums.size(),INT_MAX);
        m[0] = nums[0];
        for(int i = 1;i<nums.size();i++){
            //checking if(minimum arrays previous element and nums array current element)
            m[i] = min(m[i-1], nums[i]);
        }
        //this has formed our minimum array.
        
        //Now, our approach is simple. We consider that the minimum array that is formed is our leftmost element.
        //While the nums element is our middle element.
        //And for right element that is third element we are going to use and stack.
        
        //First, why did we consider minimum arrayv element as left?
        //This is because of 132 pattern. We can see that
        // middle>left and middle>right
        // left<middle and left<right
        // right<middle and right>left
        
        
        //And we will start traversing from last of nums and minimum array. 
        stack<int>s;
        int l,r,mid;
        for(int i = nums.size()-1;i>=0;i--){
            l = m[i];
            mid = nums[i];
            //now for right element.
            // if left element is less than middle then only do this.
            // we are doing this becasue it is possible that in some case we can find that left element == middle or the left element > mid so we are checking first.
            if(l<mid){
                //if the element at stack top<=l then only pop.
                while(!s.empty() && s.top()<=l) s.pop();
                if(!s.empty() && s.top()<mid && s.top()>l){
                    return true;
                }
                //if the stack is empty then push.
                else{
                    s.push(mid);
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
