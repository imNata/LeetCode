# Approach
As we are following the approach of using a map. The intution we are going to follow is: 
* First insert a element in the map and, 
* Then loop to check if the value ```(k-current)``` exists.

### Example & Explanation
nums = [3,1,3,4,3], k=6

Firstly, initialise map with nums[0]. Hence ```m[3] = 1```
Now traverse the nums from 1 to n. Current Value = 1

Acc. to Ques, we need to find 2 number whose sum = given k
So let us create a equation for us=> ```x+y = k```
Now what our approach is: let ```x``` be our current number i.e ```nums[i]``` and to find the second number we can see that second number ```y = k-x```.
Hence if we have the number ```y``` with us then we can say that we have found a pair whose sum = k.


*For i=1, nums[i] = 1.*
we can see that condition does not satisfies so we insert this number in the map.
**Now current Map=**
<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Key</th>
    <th>Value</th>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</table>


*For i=2, nums[i] = 3.*
We can see that there exists m.count(k-nums[i]) && m[k-nums[i]]>0 i.e yes there is a key (m.count(6-3)) in the map also, its freq is greater than 0.
So we increment the count. i.e count = 1. And at same time, we will decrement the value of m[3]. So m[3] = 0.
**Now current Map=**
<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Key</th>
    <th>Value</th>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</table>


*For i=3, nums[i] = 4.*
The conditions doesn't meet as we dont have any key (2) in the map. So we insert nums[i] in map.
**Now current Map=**
<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Key</th>
    <th>Value</th>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</table>


*For i=4, nums[i] = 3.*
Now we check for the condition m.count(k-nums[i]) && m[k-nums[i]]>0. So we can see that m.count(6-3) will return true. As there is a key(with 3) in the map. But m[k-nums[i]]>0 will return false. So finally we move to else condition.
And, we will insert 3 in map.
**Now current Map=**
<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Key</th>
    <th>Value</th>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</table>


Now, as we are at the end of nums so move out of loop and return the count.
return count. Which is 1.


# Algorithm
**Step1:** First, initialise a map with value [preferred ```nums[0]```]

**Step2:** Now loop throight values of nums from 1->n

**Step3:** Inside Loop:- first check if the vlaue (k-nums[i]) exists in loop and the freq of (k-nums[i])>0
* If this holds, then, we decrement the freq and increase the count.
* Else, we oush the current value(nums[i]) in the map.
	
**Step4:** Atlast, after coming out of loop, we will return the count.

# Code

```
class Solution {
public:
    int maxOperations(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int count = 0;
        unordered_map<int,int>m; //for easy push O(1)
        m[nums[0]]++; //initialise the map with nums[0] value.
        for(int i=1;i<nums.size();i++){
            // Checking 2 conditions 
            // If we have (k-nums[i] ) in map  as well as its frequency is greater than 0.
            // We are checking for m.count(k-nums[i]) this tells us that we have this key in map or not?
            // While the second condition makes sure that freq is >0 as the previous condition will return true even if the value of the map = 0.
            if(m.count(k-nums[i]) && m[k-nums[i]]>0){
                m[k-nums[i]]--;
                count++;
            }
            //If the above condition is not true, then push current value in map.
            else {
                m[nums[i]]++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```
